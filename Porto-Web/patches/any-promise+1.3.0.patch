 ### Support for old Node.js versions
 
-Node.js versions prior to `v0.12` may have contained buggy versions of the global `Promise`. For this reason, the global `Promise` is not loaded automatically for these old versions.  If using `any-promise` in Node.js versions versions `<= v0.12`, the user should register a desired implementation.
 
 If an implementation is not registered, `any-promise` will attempt to discover an installed `Promise` implementation.  If no implementation can be found, an error will be thrown on `require('any-promise')`.  While the auto-discovery usually avoids errors, it is non-deterministic. It is recommended that the user always register a preferred implementation for older Node.js versions.
 
-This auto-discovery is only available for Node.jS versions prior to `v0.12`. Any newer versions will always default to the global `Promise` implementation.
